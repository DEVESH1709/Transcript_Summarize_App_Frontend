# Transcript Summarize App Frontend

## Overview
This is the frontend for the AI-powered meeting notes summarizer and sharer. It allows users to upload transcript files, enter custom prompts, generate summaries using AI, edit the summaries, and share them via email.

## Approach & Process
1. **Transcript Upload:**
   - Users upload a `.txt` transcript file using a simple file input.
   - The file is read and sent to the backend for processing.

2. **Custom Prompt:**
   - Users enter a prompt/instruction to guide the AI summarization (e.g., "Summarize in bullet points").

3. **Generate Summary:**
   - On clicking "Generate Summary", the frontend sends the transcript and prompt to the backend API.
   - The backend returns a structured summary generated by Groq's LLM.

4. **Edit Summary:**
   - The summary is displayed in an editable text area for user modifications.

5. **Share via Email:**
   - Users can enter recipient email addresses and send the edited summary via email.

## Tech Stack
- **React:** UI library for building interactive components.
- **Vite:** Fast build tool and development server.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **lucide-react:** Icon library for modern UI icons.
- **Fetch API:** For communicating with the backend.

## Key Features
- Minimal, functional UI focused on usability.
- File upload with remove (cross) button for easy management.
- Prompt input for custom summarization instructions.
- Editable summary area.
- Email form for sharing summaries.
- Error handling for large files and failed requests.

## How to Run Locally
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Set the backend API URL in `.env`:
   - `VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000` (or your deployed backend URL)
4. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

## Deployment
- Build the frontend:
  ```
  npm run build
  ```
- Deploy the `dist` folder to Vercel, Netlify, or any static hosting service.
- Set `VITE_API_URL` to your deployed backend URL in the hosting dashboard if needed.

## Notes
- The UI is intentionally basic for maximum functionality and clarity.
- For large transcripts, ensure the backend can handle the file size.
- Do not commit sensitive files like `.env` to version control.
